    <p> In 1996, two students at Stanford University were working on a digital library project when they came up with a unique way of mathematically categorizing Web pages. They realized that their breakthrough could revolutionize the way search engines worked by prioritizing pages that the users themselves thought were more useful to them. The search engine they created, Google, became the most used search engine on the Web, and their company became a dominant force on the Internet.</p>
    <div style="background-color:cadetblue">
    <h3>search engine</h3> </div>
    <p>an the Web's early days, the contents of a Web page's “keywords” meta tag heavily weighted its ranking among the search engines. The practice of “keyword stuffing”, or loading a meta tag with repeated keywords in order to artificially inflate its ranking, forced search engines to reassess the value of this meta-tag. Today, the “keywords” tag has very little SEO influence on websites. While it might still be used in some custom search applications, Google completely disregards the contents of this tag in its indexing
